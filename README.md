# Data Structures & Algorithms - Refresher
Data Structures and Algorithms implementations using Python. 
Also contains assignments and Projects from Udacity Nanodegree.

Project01 - does Big O notation analysis on a few sample scenarios
All the analyses of scenarios are mentioned in the explanation file.

Data Structures Scenarios - contains sample implementations for LRU cache (Least Recently Used), Huffman coding algorithm, and Block Chain, etc. All the analyses of scenarios are mentioned in the explanation file.

Algorithm Problems - contains sample implementations for some interesting algorithm problems, such as Floored square root, rotated array binary search, Rearranging digits to form maximum sum of two numbers, Trie autocomplete, HttpRouter using Trie, and getting min-max number in single pass.

Route Planner - A-star search algorithm - folder contains a version implementation of a route planner based on 'A*' search algorithm. This uses a map object that has details of nodes (cities) and connections between them. Instead of taking a greedy move at each step, A* also considers heuristics (smart guess) based on the distance to the end node. Two pictures are also added for explanation of test cases. The main code is called from the jupyter notebook.
